NOTES


In your FastAPI application, the order of these two endpoint definitions matters because of the way path parameters are handled:

-> @app.get("/blog/all"): This endpoint matches the exact path /blog/all.

-> @app.get("/blog/{id}"): This endpoint matches any path that starts with /blog/ followed by any value, and that value is 
captured in the id parameter.


This order-sensitive pattern matching is a common feature in web frameworks that use path parameters, 
and it's essential to understand when defining your routes to ensure that requests are routed to the correct endpoint.
